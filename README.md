# Fragrance

A project made for a 3 days hackathon in partnership with the L'Or√©al group.
Users start by answering about their taste for some common scents, and then the app recommends them the fragrances most compatible with their preferences.

The frontend is made with React.
It uses Vite as the build tool and React Router for routing.
The style is made with vanilla CSS.

The backend is an Express.js (Node.js) API server, retrieving data from a MySQL database.
